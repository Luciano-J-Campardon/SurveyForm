# SurveyForm
This is my first project from the Responsive Web design course of Free Code Camp, a Survey Form.
As you can see, it's a very basic project made with HTML and CSS, with the objective of trying to grasp the fundamental concepts of the two aforementioned.
Personally, I think it looks decently good, so I'm satisfied with the final result.
